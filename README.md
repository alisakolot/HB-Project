# HB-Project

'On the Reel' is a social media inspired web app showcasing the best features of Instagram and Facebook. 
The app implements a media uploading feature on each user's profile as well as a dropdown menu displaying the 
user's followers. The backend is built with SQLAlchemy, Postgresql, and Python. Front end features are constructed with Javascript and JQuery, 
styling in HTML/CSS. 

The web app features a 'Feed' page where each user can view all public content and react with it using the Facebook
reaction button toolbar and subscriber and view to a user's profile. 

The minimal viable product goals of the project was to create an app that would allow users to have a personal profile 
and display photos to their page as well as the feed. 

In the future the app will implement a chat feature that would allow users to message each other.
