## On the Reel

'On the Reel' is a social media inspired web app showcasing the best features of Instagram and Facebook. 
The app implements a media uploading feature on each user's profile as well as a dropdown menu displaying the 
user's followers. The backend is built with SQLAlchemy, Postgresql, and Python. Front end features are constructed with Javascript and JQuery, 
styling in HTML/CSS. 

The web app features a Feed page where each user can view all public content and react to it using the 
reaction button toolbar. Each card on the feed features the user's content and a 
and subscriber and view to a user's profile. 

The minimal viable product goals of the project was to create an app that would allow users to have a personal profile 
and display media to their page as well as the feed. 

In the future the app will implement a chat feature that would allow users to message each other. 

## About Me

Alisa Kolot is a composer and musician turned software engineer. Her interest in technology began when she contributed audio to Harvardâ€™s Library Innovation Lab's immersive audio-visual environment, Alterspace. At Alterspace was inspired by the accessibility of the user interfaces that lended agency to the patron, allowing them to manipulate their own immersive audio-visual environment. This sparked her interest in creating 'On the Real,' an web application that facilitates user interaction. In the future she looks forward to making music and visual art more accessible by using touchless technology.
