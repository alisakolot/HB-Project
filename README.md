## On the Reel

'On the Reel' is a social media inspired web app showcasing the best features of Instagram and Facebook. 
The app implements a media uploading feature on each user's profile as well as a dropdown menu displaying the 
user's followers. The backend is built with SQLAlchemy, Postgresql, and Python. Front end features are constructed with Javascript and JQuery, 
styling in HTML/CSS. 

The web app features a Feed page where each user can view all public content and react to it using the 
reaction button toolbar. Each card on the feed features the user's content and a 
and subscriber and view to a user's profile. 

The minimal viable product goals of the project was to create an app that would allow users to have a personal profile 
and display media to their page as well as the feed. 

In the future the app will implement a chat feature that would allow users to message each other.
